# Collision System

Regardless of the shape, our collision contact information will always contain:

- start point
- end point
- a normal direction
- the depth of the collision

## Collision Detection

1. Collision Detection (shape specific)
2. Is Colliding?
3. Compute Collision Information
4. Collision Resolution (shape agnostic)
