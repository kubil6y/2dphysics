# Rigid Bodies

- Different than particles (where shape and rotation could be mostly ignored), rigid bodies have **shape**, **rotation** and **center of mass**.
- The formulas for displacement, velocity, acceleration, and forces discussed in the previous sections apply as well for rigid bodies.
- We'll implement three main shape classes:
  - Circles
  - Polygons
  - Boxes (inherit from polygon)
