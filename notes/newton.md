# Motion of Physical Bodies

Three Laws of Motion:

1. **Inertia**: If no force is applied on an object, its velocity shall **not** change.
2. **Force, Mass, Acceleration**: `F=ma` The force action on an object is equal to the mass of the object multipled by its acceleration (rate of change of velocity).
   - **Mass** is a measure of **how difficult** it is to change the velocity of an object. `a=F/m`
3. **Action and Reaction**: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, whenever one body exerts a force on another, the second body exerts a force of the same magnitude and opposite direction on the first.
