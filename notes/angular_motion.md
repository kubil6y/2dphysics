# Angular Motion

- As the body rotates, θ will change. The rate at which θ changes is called **angular velocity&**, ω.
- Likewise, as the body rotates the rate at which ω changes is called **angular acceleration**, α.

```
ω = Δθ / Δt

ω: Angular velocity (rad/s)
Δθ: Angular displacement (radians)
Δt: Time interval (seconds)

α = Δω / Δt

α: Angular acceleration (rad/s²)
Δω: Change in angular velocity (rad/s)
Δt: Time interval (seconds)

Δθ = ω * t + (α * t^2) / 2      (angular kinematics)
ΔX = V0 * t + (a * t^2) / 2   (linear kinematics)
```
