# Torque

- We can initiate rotational motion by applying "torque", œÑ
- Torque is defined as the ability of a force to rotate an object around an axis.

```
Torque (œÑ) = Force (F) √ó Distance (d) √ó sin(Œ∏)
```

- œÑ represents torque
- F is the force applied
  d is the distance from the pivot point to the line of action of the force
- sin(Œ∏) accounts for the angle at which the force is applied

- Torque is the object's **Moment of Inertia** multipied by its **Angular Acceleration**.

```
Torque (œÑ) = Moment of Inertia (I) √ó Angular Acceleration (Œ±)
```

- Torque (œÑ): The rotational force applied to an object.
- Moment of Inertia (I): A measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation, depending on its mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation.
- Angular Acceleration (Œ±): The rate at which the angular velocity of the object changes with time.

This relationship is analogous to Newton's second law for linear motion (ùêπ=m.a), where force is the product of mass and linear acceleration. In rotational dynamics, torque plays a similar role, with moment of inertia serving as the rotational equivalent of mass.

Wikipedia definition: The moment of inertia, otherwise known as the mass moment of inertia, **angular mass**, second moment of mass, or most accurately, rotational inertia, of a rigid body is a quantity that determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration about a rotational axis, akin to how mass determines the force needed for a desired acceleration. It depends on the body's mass distribution and the axis chosen, with larger moments requiring more torque to change the body's rate of rotation.

## Moment of Inertia of a Solid Circle (Disk)

For a solid circle (or disk) rotating about an axis through its center:

```
I = (1/2) * m * r^2
```

I: Moment of inertia
m: Mass of the circle
r: Radius of the circle

## Moment of Inertia of a Solid Rectangle

For a solid rectangle (or rectangular plate) rotating about an axis perpendicular to its width and height (center axis):

```
I = (1/12) * m * (w^2 + h^2)
```

I: Moment of inertia
m: Mass of the rectangle
w: Width of the rectangle
h: Height of the rectangle
