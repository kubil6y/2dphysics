## Forces

- A particle will **accelerate** based on the **forces** that are acting on it.
- Forces may come from different sources depending on the kind of simulation. It can be _gravity, wind, magnetism_ etc. Or it can be a force between particies, such as attraction or repulsion.
- For each frame, we are interested in the final sum of all forces (net force) that is being applied to the particle.
- The **mass** of an object determines how difficult it is to accelerate that object once a force is applied to it.

Note: Kinematics: velocity, acceleration but no forces...
